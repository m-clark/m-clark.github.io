### What I do

I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Scientist for [OneSix](https://www.onesixsolutions.com/), where I engage with client projects across multiple industries, helping them get the most from their data to maximize customer satisfaction, increase profitability, and explore new data-enabled territory. In my role, I strive to use the best tools to translate complex results into actionable insights.



Throughout my career in data science, I have navigated a vast landscape of *modeling*, *visualizing*, and *understanding* data. I have conducted causal inference for marketing campaigns, classified biomedical images to detect pathology, analyzed text to uncover political sentiment, and explored baboon survival rates based on their social status. My experience spans dozens of industries and academic disciplines, helping clients and researchers unlock the full potential of their data.



Additionally, I have a strong background in teaching, writing, and conducting workshops on these topics, empowering others to gain expertise and become self-sufficient. Recently, I authored a book - [Models Demystified](https://m-clark.github.io/book-of-models/) - which offers a comprehensive overview of the statistical and machine learning landscape, along with related topics. It will be available from CRC Press in 2025.


I am passionate about doing quality work that answers the questions at hand. What drew me to the world of data science and keeps my interest is that it frees me to engage in many different domains, and it provides a great many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans are most interested in. My CV can be found [here](../cv-non-acad.html).




### Personal

I was born and raised in Texas, but have lived a good chunk of my life in the Midwest. I currently live in Ann Arbor with my wife, our daughter, and our dog Sulu. We tend to keep things simple, and like to go on walks and hikes in the neighborhood and surrounding areas of A2, take the occasional trip to some place new, and make big deals out of the little things. 



### Academic Background


While my interest is in data science generally, I started off majoring in [psychology](http://www.psy.tcu.edu/) and [philosophy](http://www.phil.tcu.edu/) as an undergraduate, and eventually obtained a Ph.D. in [Experimental Psychology](http://psychology.unt.edu/). During graduate school, I became interested in statistics for practical reasons, eventually choosing it as a concentration, and I also started consulting at that time. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and I've been exploring and analyzing data ever since.

### Present

Currently I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist for [Strong Analytics](https://www.strong.io/), where I engage with several client projects across multiple industries such as real estate, entertainment, education, and health care, helping them get the most from their data to maximize customer satisfaction and outreach, increase profitability, and explore new data-enabled territory.

Previously, I was a lead statistician for [CSCAR](https://cscar.research.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, and before that, I was a statistical consultant with the [Center for Social Science Research](http://cssr.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. In both settings I provided analytical, visualization, programming, conceptual, and other support to the larger research community. -->
<!-- Moreover, I excel at translating complex results into actionable insights. -->

<!-- Analytically, I bring a wealth of experience with a diverse array of modeling techniques, including traditional statistical models, machine learning, deep learning, and Bayesian approaches. Additionally, I have a strong background in teaching, writing, and conducting 
workshops on these topics, empowering others to gain expertise and become self-sufficient.  -->
