My book, *Models Demystified: A Practical Guide from Linear Regression to Deep Learning*, co-authored with Seth Berry, is now published! It was a long journey, but we're excited to share it with you. We started in mid-2023 with the goal of ending by the end of that year. That naivety was quickly dashed, but we ended up with a much more comprehensive book than we originally planned when all was said and done. Since we started, the AI boom has continued to explode, modeling techniques have advanced, and I also ended up becoming a father - a notably greater accomplishment than this book! 😄 While many things have changed, we hope the book finds you well and helps you understand the models that power the world around you. Have fun!
