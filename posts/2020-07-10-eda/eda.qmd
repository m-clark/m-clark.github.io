## Introduction

In R there are many tools available to help you dive in and explore your data. However, in consulting I still see a lot of people using base R's [table]{.func style=""} and [summary]{.func style=""} functions, followed by a lot of work to get the result into a more presentable format. My own frustrations led to me creating a package ([tidyext](https://m-clark.github.io/tidyext/)) for personal use in this area. While that suits me fine, there are tools that can go much further with little effort. Recently, Staniak & Biecek @staniak2019landscape wrote an article in the R Journal exploring several of such packages, so I thought I'd try them out for myself, and take others along with me for that ride.

As this will be a workshop/demo, I've created a separate repo and document to make it easier to find, so here is the link: [https://m-clark.github.io/exploratory-data-analysis-tools/](https://m-clark.github.io/exploratory-data-analysis-tools/])

The packages demoed are:

-   [arsenal]{.pack style=""}
-   [DataExplorer]{.pack style=""}
-   [dataMaid]{.pack style=""}
-   [gtsummary]{.pack style=""}
-   [janitor]{.pack style=""} (not explored in the previous article)
-   [SmartEDA]{.pack style=""}
-   [summarytools]{.pack style=""}
-   [visdat]{.pack style=""}

```{r echo = F, out.width='20%'}
# knitr::include_graphics('../../img/tukey.png')
```
