I can provide inference for models on millions of observations, classify biomedical images to determine pathology, and scrape the web to explore political sentiment. What’s more, I can help others understand the results and take appropriate action regarding them.\nAnalytically speaking, I have a fairly wide exposure to modeling techniques, from traditional models to their extensions in clustered, temporal, spatial and nonlinear contexts. I have employed latent variable models, machine learning techniques, Bayesian approaches, dealt with unstructured data (e.g. text analysis), and more. Moreover, I have taught, written about, or conducted workshops on these topics, helping others gain expertise to become self-sufficient in their own efforts.\nI spend most of my programming time in the R world, with which I have many years of experience using it as my primary programming tool. I have written countless lines of code to extract information, examine complex relationships, and visualize everything from the mundane to the abstract.\nI spend the bulk of my non-R coding with Python and other stuff like Stan. However, I have had exposure to traditional statistical packages, and some more specialized. I also have to consistently dive into web-oriented programming as necessary, e.g. JavaScript, Markdown, CSS and the like, and use tools like R and Python for web-scraping. I like programming and solving problems with it, and I’m lucky enough to spend regular time simply learning new statistical and programming tricks.\nPersonal\nDisplaced Texan… one-time psycho-philosopher… aesthetically leans toward De Stijl, Barthelme, Ashbery, and synthwave… has been known to grow things like dahlias, okra, and exquisitely hot peppers… walks, runs & pedals more than he drives… sometimes knows what he’s talking about…\nAcademic Background\n While my interest is in data science generally, I started off majoring in psychology and philosophy as an undergraduate, and eventually obtained a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology. During graduate school, I became interested in statistics for practical reasons, eventually choosing it as a concentration, and I also started consulting at that time. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and I’ve been exploring and analyzing data ever since. \nCurrent\n Currently I am a Data Scientist for Strong Analytics, where I provide analytical insights to enable clients from a variety of industries meet their goals. \n Previously, I was a lead statistician for CSCAR at the University of Michigan. Before that, I was a statistical consultant with the Center for Social Science Research at the University of Notre Dame. In both settings I provided analytical, visualization, programming, conceptual, and other support to the larger research community. \n\nI am passionate about doing quality work that answers the questions at hand. What drew me to the world of data science and keeps my interest is that it frees me to engage in whatever science I like, and provides a great many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans are most interested in.

Here you will find R packages, code demos and more, but for my latest efforts, check me out on GitHub.\nR Packages\n mixedup A package for extracting results from mixed models from several packages that are easy to use and viable for presentation.  \n confusionMatrix Given predictions and a target variable, this package provides a wealth of summary statistics that can be calculated from a single confusion matrix, and return tidy results with as few dependencies as possible.  \n 198R R with its collar flipped, or the movie Drive if it was all about R programming, writing R code on a beach in Miami as the sun sets, R wearing sunglasses at night, R asking you to take it home tonight because it doesn’t want to let you go until you see the light, Countach > Testarrosa, but Delorean > all except R, R if Automan had lasted longer than 1 season, driving down Mulholland Dr. at night thinking about R code, R playing a cello at the end of a dock on a lake before taking a ride in a badass helicopter, R with its hair all done up with Aquanet… You get the idea.  \n visibly This is a collection of functions that I use related to visualization, e.g. the palette generating function (create_palette) and clean visualization themes for ggplot and plotly. In addition, there are visualizations specific to mixed and additive models.  \n 538 football club rankings This package grabs the table located at 538, and additionally does some summary by league and country.  \n gammit The package provides a set of functions to aid using mgcv (possibly solely) for mixed models. Mostly superseded by mixedup.  \n tidyext This package is a collection of functions that do the things I commonly need to do with data while doing other processing within the dataverse. I work with data for myself and others everyday, and use these functions quite often.  \n lazerhawk While the name is more or less explanatory, to clarify, this is a package of miscellaneous functions that are mostly useful to me.  \nIn addition to these, though they are not publicly available, I’ve created even more involved packages for specific project work.\nCode Snippets\nThe vast majority of these code snippets are conceptual demonstrations of more complicated models. The audience is generally faculty, researchers, graduate students in applied fields who, like I did, want to go beyond their basic statistical training. However, I hope it helps anyone who happens to stumble across it. I don’t really update this page anymore, as I’ve cleaned and moved much of these over to Model Estimation by Example, so I would look for something you see here in the corresponding chapter of that document. In general, you can find all of my code at GitHub.\n\nModel Fitting\nstandard linear regression, standard logistic regression, penalized regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, newton and IRLS, nelder-mead (Python) (R), gradient descent (stochastic), bivariate probit, heckman selection, tobit, naive bayes, multinomial regression, ordinal regression, quantile regression, hurdle poisson, hurdle negbin, zero-inflated poisson, zero-inflated negbin, Cox survival, confirmatory factor analysis, Markov model, hidden Markov model (R) (Python), stochastic volatility, extreme learning machine, Chinese restaurant process, Indian buffet process, One-line models (an exercise), …\nMixed models\none factor random effects (R) (Julia) (Matlab), two factor random effects (R) (Julia) (Matlab), mixed model via ML, mixed model, mixed model with correlated random effects, See the documents section for more…\nBayesian\nBEST t-test, linear regression (Compare with BUGS version, JAGS), mixed model, mixed model with correlated random effects, beta regression, mixed model with beta response (Stan) (JAGS), mixture model, topic model, multinomial models, multilevel mediation, variational bayes regression, gaussian process, horseshoe prior, item response theory, …\nEM\nEM mixture univariate, EM mixture multivariate, EM probit, EM pca, EM probabilistic pca, EM state space model\nWiggly\nGaussian processses\nGaussian Process noisy, Gaussian Process noise-free, reproducing kernel hilbert space regression, Bayesian Gaussian process, …\nAdditive models\ncubic spline, …\nProgramming Shenanigans\nFizzBuzz test (R) (julia) (Python), Reverse a string recursively (R) (Python), Recursive Word Wrap (R) (Python), calculate compound interest recursively, get US Congress roll call data, Scrape xkcd (R) (Python), Shakespearean Insulter, spurious correlation with ratios, R matrix speedups, …\n\nShiny Apps\n Bayesian DemonstrationA simple interactive demonstration for those just starting on their Bayesian journey.  \n Historical Football DataMy annual dive into the frustration of Shiny has produced an app to explore historical football/soccer data for various European leagues (Premier, La Liga, Serie A etc.) and MLS. One can create tables for a given country/league and year selected, with some leagues having multiple tiers available, and stretching back many decades. Beyond that, one can get a specific team’s historical finishing position, league games for a specific season, all-time tables, and all-time head-to-head results (within a league).  \n Last Statements of the Texas ExecutedA demonstration of both text analysis and literate programming/document generation with a dynamic and interactive research document. The texts regard the last statements of offenders in Texas.  \n A History of TornadosBecause I had too much time on my hands and wanted to try out the dashboard feature of R Markdown. Maps tornado activity from 1950-2015. \n\n\n\n",

Most are demonstration of statistical concepts or programming, and may be geared towards beginners or more advanced. I group them based on whether they are more focused on statistical concepts, programming, or miscellaneous.\nLatest\n Model Estimation by ExampleThis shows ‘by-hand’ code for various models and estimation approaches, from linear regression to Bayesian multilevel mediation models, and demonstrations from penalized maximum likelihood to stochastic gradient descent.  \nPopular\n Bayesian BasicsThis serves as a conceptual introduction to Bayesian modeling with examples using R and Stan.  \n Generalized Additive ModelsAn introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis on generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.  \n Mixed Models with R\nThis document focuses on mixed effects models using R, covering basic random effects models (random intercepts and slopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of realms beyond. \n Practical Data Science\nFocus is on common data science tools and techniques in R, including data processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and presentation of results. Exercises may be found in the document, and demonstrations of most content in Python is available via Jupyter notebooks. \n Structural Equation ModelingThis document (and related workshop) focuses on structural equation modeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. Topics include: graphical models (directed and undirected, including path analysis, bayesian networks, and network analysis), mediation, moderation, latent variable models (including principal components analysis and ‘factor analysis’), measurement models, structural equation models, mixture models, growth curves, IRT, collaborative filtering/recommender systems, hidden Markov models, multi-group models etc.  \n Introduction to Machine LearningA gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some application in R. It covers topics such as loss functions, cross-validation, regularization, and bias-variance trade-off, techniques such as penalized regression, random forests, and neural nets, and more.  \nStatistical\nModeling in R\n Data Modeling in RThis document demonstrates a wide array of statistical and other models in R. Generic code is provided for standard regression, mixed, additive, survival, and latent variable models, principal components, factor analysis, SEM, cluster analysis, time series, spatial models, zero-altered models, text analysis, Bayesian analysis, machine learning and more. \nThe document is designed for newcomers to R, whether in a statistical sense, or just a programming one. It also should appeal to those working in other packages who are curious how to do the same sorts of things in R.\nBayesian\n Bayesian BasicsThis serves as a conceptual introduction to Bayesian modeling with examples using R and Stan.  \n MCMC algorithmsList of MCMC algorithms with brief descriptions.  \n Bayesian DemonstrationA simple interactive demonstration for those just starting on their Bayesian journey.  \nMixed Models\n Mixed Models with R\nThis workshop focuses on mixed effects models using R, covering basic random effects models (random intercepts and slopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of realms beyond. \n Mixed Models OverviewAn overview that introduces mixed models for those with varying technical/statistical backgrounds.  \n Mixed Models IntroductionA non-technical document to introduce mixed models for those who have used ANOVA.  \n Clustered Data SituationsA comparison of standard models, cluster robust standard errors, fixed effect models, mixed models (random effects models), generalized estimating equations (GEE), and latent growth curve models for dealing with clustered data (e.g. longitudinal, hierarchical etc.).  \n Mixed Model EstimationDemonstration of mixed models via maximum likelihood and link to additive models. \n Mixed and Growth Curve ModelsA comparison of the mixed model vs. latent variable approach for longitudinal data (growth curve models), with simulation of performance in situations of small sample sizes. \nLatent Variables/SEM\n Structural Equation ModelingThis document (and related workshop) focuses on structural equation modeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. The initial workshop was given to an audience of varying background and statistical skill, but the document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered. It is completely R-based, with special emphasis on the lavaan package. It will continue to be a work in progress, particularly the sections after the SEM chapter. Topics include: graphical models (directed and undirected, including path analysis, bayesian networks, and network analysis), mediation, moderation, latent variable models (including principal components analysis and ‘factor analysis’), measurement models, structural equation models, mixture models, growth curves. Topics I hope to provide overviews of in the future include other latent variable techniques/extensions such as IRT, collaborative filtering/recommender systems, hidden Markov models, multi-group models etc.  \n Factor Analysis and Related MethodsThis document gives a brief overview of many matrix factorization, dimension reduction, and latent variable techniques. Here is a list:  \n\nPrincipal Components Analysis - Factor Analysis - Probabilistic Components Analysis - Non-negative Matrix Factorization - Latent Dirichlet Allocation - Structural Equation Modeling - Item Response Theory - Independent Components Analysis - Multidimensional Scaling - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-sne) - Recommender Systems - Hidden Markov Models - Random Effects Models - Bayesian Approaches - Mixture Models - k-means Cluster Analysis - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis - Latent Class Analysis\n\n Latent Variables, Sum Scores, Single ItemsIt is very common to use sum scores of several variables as a single entity to be used in subsequent analysis (e.g. a regression model). Some may even more use a single variable even though multiple indicators are available. Assuming the multiple measures indicate a latent construct, such typical practice would be problematic relative to using estimated factor scores, either constructed as part of a two-stage process or as part of a structural equation model. This document covers simulations in which comparisons in performance are made between latent variable and sum score or single item approaches.  \n Lord’s ParadoxSummary of Pearl’s 2014 and 2013 technical reports on some modeling situations such as Lord’s Paradox and Simpson’s Paradox that lead to surprising results that are initially at odds with our intuition. Looks particularly at the issue of change scores vs. controlling for baseline.  \nOther Statistical\n Generalized Additive ModelsAn introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis on generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.  \n Introduction to Machine LearningA gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some application in R.  \n Fractional RegressionA quick primer regarding data between zero and one, including zero and one.  \n Categorical Regression ModelsAn overview of regression models for binary, multinomial, and ordinal outcomes, with connections among various types of models.  \n Topic Modeling DemoA demonstration of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling in R.  \n Comparing Measures of DependencyA summary of articles that look at various measures of dependency Pearson’s r, Spearman’s rho, and Hoeffding’s D, and newer ones such as Distance Correlation and Maximal Information Coefficient. \nProgramming\nCheck the workshops section also for programming-related content.\nPractical Data Science (more details about this document below). The intention was to cover five key topics: basic information processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and publication/presentation.\n FastRA notebook on how to make R faster before or irrespective of the machinery used. Topics include avoiding loops, vectorization, faster I/O etc.  \n Engaging the Web with RDocument regarding the use of R for web scraping, extracting data via an API, interactive web-based visualizations, and producing web-ready documents. It serves as an overview of ways one might start to use R for web-based activities as opposed to a hand-on approach.  \nMiscellaneous\n R for Social ScienceThis was put together in a couple of days under duress, and is put here in case someone can find it useful (and thus make the time spent on it not completely wasted).  \n\n\n\n",

They are roughly in order of how recently they’ve been given. Some were not so much workshops as talks without any expectation of hands-on exercises or similar, so may have a bit less content or won’t be as useful without the context.\nSomewhat recent efforts…\nI did an R Series covering various topics, the content of which is all found here: Practical Data Science (more details about this document below). The intention was to cover five key topics: basic information processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and publication/presentation.\nOther workshops include:\nDistill for R Markdown\nExploratory Data Analysis Tools\nMixed Models with R\nMore Mixed Models\nPatchwork and gganimate\nLibrary Learning Analytics Workshop\nGetting More from RStudio\nLatent Variable Models\nGeneralized Additive Models\nMixed Models\nTexts\nThese are the texts that serve as the basis for the workshops.\n Practical Data Science\nFocus is on common data science tools and techniques in R, including data processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and presentation of results. Exercises may be found in the document, and demonstrations of most content in Python is available via Jupyter notebooks. \n Easy Bayes with rstanarm and brms\nThis workshop provides an overview of the rstanarm and brms packages. Basic modeling syntax is provided, as well as diagnostic checking, model comparison (posterior predictive checks , WAIC/LOO ), and how to get more from the models (marginal effects , posterior probabilities posterior probabilities, etc.). \n Introduction to R Markdown\nThis workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R Markdown. After an introduction to concepts related to reproducible programming and research, demonstrations of standard markdown as well as overviews of different formats will be provided, including exercises. This document has been superseded by Practical Data Science, and will no longer be updated. \n Factor Analysis and Related Methods\nThis workshop will expose participants to a variety of related techniques that might fall under the heading of ‘factor analysis’, latent variable modeling, dimension reduction and similar, such as principal components analysis, factor analysis, and measurement models, with possible exposure to and demonstration of latent Dirichlet allocation, mixture models, item response theory, and others. Brief overviews with examples of the more common techniques will be provided. \n Text Analysis with R\nThis document covers a wide range of topics, including how to process text generally, and demonstrations of sentiment analysis, parts-of-speech tagging, and topic modeling. Exercises are provided for some topics. Some Python examples will also be added at some point. \n Mixed Models with R\nThis workshop focuses on mixed effects models using R, covering basic random effects models (random intercepts and slopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of realms beyond. \n Structural Equation Modeling\nThis document regards a recent workshop given on structural equation modeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. The document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered, though it is R-based, with special emphasis on the lavaan package. \nBeen awhile…\nThese haven’t been given recently, but the content is still likely useful. Until they are updated or given again, you may also find a more fully fleshed out related work on the documents page.\n My God, it’s full of STARs! Using astrology to get more from your data.\nTalk on structured additive regression models, and generalized additive models in particular. \n Become a Bayesian in 10 Minutes\nThis document regards a talk aimed at giving an introduction Bayesian modeling in R via the Stan programming language. It doesn’t assume too much statistically or any prior Bayesian experience. For those with such experience, they can quickly work with the code or packages discussed. I post them here because they exist and provide a quick overview, but you’d get more from the more extensive document. \n Engaging the Web with RDocument regarding the use of R for web scraping, extracting data via an API, interactive web-based visualizations, and producing web-ready documents. It serves as an overview of ways one might start to use R for web-based activities as opposed to a hand-on approach.  \n Ceci n’est pas une %>%\nExploring your data with R. A workshop that introduces some newer modes of data wrangling within R, with an eye toward visualization. Focus on dplyr and magrittr packages. \n Getting More from RStudio\nAn afternoon talk on how to use RStudio for more than just coding. \n\n\n\n",
