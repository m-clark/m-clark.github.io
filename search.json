I can provide inference for models on millions of observations, classify biomedical images to determine pathology, and scrape the web to explore political sentiment. What’s more, I can help others understand the results and take appropriate action regarding them.\nAnalytically speaking, I have a fairly wide exposure to modeling techniques, from traditional models to their extensions in clustered, temporal, spatial and nonlinear contexts. I have employed latent variable models, machine learning techniques, Bayesian approaches, dealt with unstructured data (e.g. text analysis), and more. Moreover, I have taught, written about, or conducted workshops on these topics, helping others gain expertise to become self-sufficient in their own efforts.\nI spend most of my programming time in the R world, with which I have many years of experience using it as my primary programming tool. I have written countless lines of code to extract information, examine complex relationships, and visualize everything from the mundane to the abstract.\nI spend the bulk of my other efforts in coding with Python, where I’ve used it for general machine learning models, natural language processing, and other endeavors. I also have to consistently dive into other programming as necessary, such as for web development and report generation. I like programming in general and solving problems with it, and I’m lucky enough to spend regular time simply learning new modeling and programming tricks.\nPersonal\nDisplaced Texan… one-time psychologist/philosopher… aesthetically leans toward De Stijl, Barthelme, Ashbery, and synthwave… has been known to grow things like dahlias, okra, and exquisitely hot peppers… enjoys walking, running, biking… sometimes knows what he’s talking about…\nAcademic Background\n\nWhile my interest is in data science generally, I started off majoring in psychology and philosophy as an undergraduate, and eventually obtained a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology. During graduate school, I became interested in statistics for practical reasons, eventually choosing it as a concentration, and I also started consulting at that time. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and I’ve been exploring and analyzing data ever since.\n\nPresent\n\nCurrently I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist for Strong Analytics, where I provide analytical insights and programming expertise to enable clients from a variety of industries meet their goals.\n\n\nPreviously, I was a lead statistician for CSCAR at the University of Michigan, and before that, I was a statistical consultant with the Center for Social Science Research at the University of Notre Dame. In both settings I provided analytical, visualization, programming, conceptual, and other support to the larger research community.\n\n\nI am passionate about doing quality work that answers the questions at hand. What drew me to the world of data science and keeps my interest is that it frees me to engage in whatever science I like, and provides a great many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans are most interested in.

Here you will find R packages, code demos and more, but for my latest efforts, check me out on GitHub.\nR Packages\n\nmixedup\nA package for extracting results from mixed models from several packages that are easy to use and viable for presentation.\n\n\n\nconfusionMatrix\nGiven predictions and a target variable, this package provides a wealth of summary statistics that can be calculated from a single confusion matrix, and return tidy results with as few dependencies as possible.\n\n\n\n198R\nR with its collar flipped, or the movie Drive if it was all about R programming, writing R code on a beach in Miami as the sun sets, R wearing sunglasses at night, R asking you to take it home tonight because it doesn’t want to let you go until you see the light, Countach > Testarrosa, but Delorean > all except R, R if Automan had lasted longer than 1 season, driving down Mulholland Dr. at night thinking about R code, R playing a cello at the end of a dock on a lake before taking a ride in a badass helicopter, R with its hair all done up with Aquanet… You get the idea.\n\n\n\nvisibly\nThis is a collection of functions that I use related to visualization, e.g. the palette generating function (create_palette) and clean visualization themes for ggplot and plotly. In addition, there are visualizations specific to mixed and additive models.\n\n\n\n538 football club rankings\nThis package grabs the table located at 538, and additionally does some summary by league and country.\n\n\n\ngammit\nThe package provides a set of functions to aid using mgcv (possibly solely) for mixed models. Mostly superseded by mixedup.\n\n\n\ntidyext\nThis package is a collection of functions that do the things I commonly need to do with data while doing other processing within the dataverse. I work with data for myself and others everyday, and use these functions quite often.\n\n\n\nlazerhawk\nWhile the name is more or less explanatory, to clarify, this is a package of miscellaneous functions that are mostly useful to me.\n\n\nIn addition to these, though they are not publicly available, I’ve created even more involved packages for specific project work.\nCode Snippets\nThe vast majority of these code snippets are conceptual demonstrations of more complicated models. The audience is generally faculty, researchers, graduate students in applied fields who, like I did, want to go beyond their basic statistical training. However, I hope it helps anyone who happens to stumble across it. I don’t really update this page anymore, as I’ve cleaned and moved much of these over to Model Estimation by Example, so I would look for something you see here in the corresponding chapter of that document. In general, you can find all of my code at GitHub.\n\nModel Fitting\nstandard linear regression,\nstandard logistic regression,\npenalized regression,\nlasso regression,\nridge regression,\nnewton and IRLS,\nnelder-mead (Python) (R),\ngradient descent (stochastic),\nbivariate probit,\nheckman selection,\ntobit,\nnaive bayes,\nmultinomial regression,\nordinal regression,\nquantile regression,\nhurdle poisson,\nhurdle negbin,\nzero-inflated poisson,\nzero-inflated negbin,\nCox survival,\nconfirmatory factor analysis,\nMarkov model,\nhidden Markov model (R)\n(Python),\nstochastic volatility,\nextreme learning machine,\nChinese restaurant process, Indian buffet process,\nOne-line models (an exercise), …\nMixed models\none factor random effects (R)\n(Julia)\n(Matlab),\ntwo factor random effects (R)\n(Julia)\n(Matlab),\nmixed model via ML,\nmixed model,\nmixed model with correlated random effects, See the documents section for more…\nBayesian\nBEST t-test,\nlinear regression\n(Compare with BUGS version, JAGS),\nmixed model,\nmixed model with correlated random effects,\nbeta regression,\nmixed model with beta response (Stan) (JAGS),\nmixture model,\ntopic model,\nmultinomial models,\nmultilevel mediation,\nvariational bayes regression,\ngaussian process,\nhorseshoe prior,\nitem response theory, …\nEM\nEM mixture univariate,\nEM mixture multivariate,\nEM probit,\nEM pca,\nEM probabilistic pca,\nEM state space model\nWiggly\nGaussian processses\nGaussian Process noisy,\nGaussian Process noise-free,\nreproducing kernel hilbert space regression,\nBayesian Gaussian process, …\nAdditive models\ncubic spline, …\nProgramming Shenanigans\nFizzBuzz test (R) (julia) (Python),\nReverse a string recursively (R) (Python),\nRecursive Word Wrap (R) (Python),\ncalculate compound interest recursively,\nget US Congress roll call data,\nScrape xkcd (R) (Python),\nShakespearean Insulter,\nspurious correlation with ratios,\nR matrix speedups, …\n\nShiny Apps\nFun at the time, these were some my forays into the Shiny world.\n\nBayesian DemonstrationA simple interactive demonstration for those just starting on their Bayesian journey.\n\n\n\nHistorical Football DataMy annual dive into the frustration of Shiny has produced an app to explore historical football/soccer data for various European leagues (Premier, La Liga, Serie A etc.) and MLS. One can create tables for a given country/league and year selected, with some leagues having multiple tiers available, and stretching back many decades. Beyond that, one can get a specific team’s historical finishing position, league games for a specific season, all-time tables, and all-time head-to-head results (within a league).\n\n\n\nLast Statements of the Texas ExecutedA demonstration of both text analysis and literate programming/document generation with a dynamic and interactive research document. The texts regard the last statements of offenders in Texas.\n\n\n\nA History of TornadosBecause I had too much time on my hands and wanted to try out the dashboard feature of R Markdown.

Most are demonstration of statistical concepts or programming, and may be geared towards beginners or more advanced. I group them based on whether they are more focused on statistical concepts, programming, or miscellaneous.\nPopular\n\nMixed Models with R\nThis document focuses on mixed effects models using R, covering basic random effects models (random intercepts and slopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of realms beyond.\n\n\nBayesian BasicsThis serves as a conceptual introduction to Bayesian modeling with examples using R and Stan.\n\n\n\nModel Estimation by ExampleThis shows ‘by-hand’ code for various models and estimation approaches, from linear regression to Bayesian multilevel mediation models, and demonstrations from penalized maximum likelihood to stochastic gradient descent.\n\n\n\nGeneralized Additive ModelsAn introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis on generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Machine LearningA gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some application in R. It covers topics such as loss functions, cross-validation, regularization, and bias-variance trade-off, techniques such as penalized regression, random forests, and neural nets, and more.\n\n\n\nPractical Data Science\nFocus is on common data science tools and techniques in R, including data processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and presentation of results. Exercises may be found in the document, and demonstrations of most content in Python is available via Jupyter notebooks.\n\n\nStructural Equation ModelingThis document (and related workshop) focuses on structural equation modeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. Topics include: graphical models (directed and undirected, including path analysis, bayesian networks, and network analysis), mediation, moderation, latent variable models (including principal components analysis and ‘factor analysis’), measurement models, structural equation models, mixture models, growth curves, IRT, collaborative filtering/recommender systems, hidden Markov models, multi-group models etc.\n\n\nModeling/Programming Blog Posts\nDeep Linear Models\nExploring Time\nProgramming Odds and Ends\nDeep Learning for Tabular Data II\nThe Double Descent Phenomenon\nDeep Learning for Tabular Data\nPractical Bayesian Analysis (I, II)\nMicro-macro Models\nPredictions with an Offset\nFactor Analysis and Related Methods\nConvergence Problems in Mixed Models\nCategorical Random Effects\nMixed Models for Big Data\nFractional Regression\nGroup Comparisons in SEM\nEmpirical Bayes\nShrinkage in Mixed Models\nMediation Models\nStatistical\nModels By Example\n\nModel Estimation by ExampleThis shows ‘by-hand’ code for various models and estimation approaches, from linear regression to Bayesian multilevel mediation models, and demonstrations from penalized maximum likelihood to stochastic gradient descent.\n\n\nModeling in R\n\nData Modeling in RThis document demonstrates a wide array of statistical and other models in R. Generic code is provided for standard regression, mixed, additive, survival, and latent variable models, principal components, factor analysis, SEM, cluster analysis, time series, spatial models, zero-altered models, text analysis, Bayesian analysis, machine learning and more.\n\nThe document is designed for newcomers to R, whether in a statistical sense, or just a programming one. It also should appeal to those working in other packages who are curious how to do the same sorts of things in R.\nBayesian\n\nBayesian BasicsThis serves as a conceptual introduction to Bayesian modeling with examples using R and Stan.\n\n\n\nMCMC algorithmsList of MCMC algorithms with brief descriptions.\n\n\n\nBayesian DemonstrationA simple interactive demonstration for those just starting on their Bayesian journey.\n\n\nMixed Models\n\nMixed Models with R\nThis workshop focuses on mixed effects models using R, covering basic random effects models (random intercepts and slopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of realms beyond.\n\n\nMixed Models OverviewAn overview that introduces mixed models for those with varying technical/statistical backgrounds.\n\n\n\nMixed Models IntroductionA non-technical document to introduce mixed models for those who have used ANOVA.\n\n\n\nClustered Data SituationsA comparison of standard models, cluster robust standard errors, fixed effect models, mixed models (random effects models), generalized estimating equations (GEE), and latent growth curve models for dealing with clustered data (e.g. longitudinal, hierarchical etc.).\n\n\n\nMixed Model EstimationDemonstration of mixed models via maximum likelihood and link to additive models.\n\n\nMixed and Growth Curve ModelsA comparison of the mixed model vs. latent variable approach for longitudinal data (growth curve models), with simulation of performance in situations of small sample sizes.\n\nLatent Variables/SEM\n\nStructural Equation ModelingThis document (and related workshop) focuses on structural equation modeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. The initial workshop was given to an audience of varying background and statistical skill, but the document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered. It is completely R-based, with special emphasis on the lavaan package. It will continue to be a work in progress, particularly the sections after the SEM chapter. Topics include: graphical models (directed and undirected, including path analysis, bayesian networks, and network analysis), mediation, moderation, latent variable models (including principal components analysis and ‘factor analysis’), measurement models, structural equation models, mixture models, growth curves. Topics I hope to provide overviews of in the future include other latent variable techniques/extensions such as IRT, collaborative filtering/recommender systems, hidden Markov models, multi-group models etc.\n\n\n\nFactor Analysis and Related MethodsThis document gives a brief overview of many matrix factorization, dimension reduction, and latent variable techniques. Here is a list:\n\n\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis - Factor Analysis - Probabilistic Components Analysis - Non-negative Matrix Factorization - Latent Dirichlet Allocation - Structural Equation Modeling - Item Response Theory - Independent Components Analysis - Multidimensional Scaling - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-sne) - Recommender Systems - Hidden Markov Models - Random Effects Models - Bayesian Approaches - Mixture Models - k-means Cluster Analysis - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis - Latent Class Analysis\n\n\nLatent Variables, Sum Scores, Single ItemsIt is very common to use sum scores of several variables as a single entity to be used in subsequent analysis (e.g. a regression model). Some may even more use a single variable even though multiple indicators are available. Assuming the multiple measures indicate a latent construct, such typical practice would be problematic relative to using estimated factor scores, either constructed as part of a two-stage process or as part of a structural equation model. This document covers simulations in which comparisons in performance are made between latent variable and sum score or single item approaches.\n\n\n\nLord’s ParadoxSummary of Pearl’s 2014 and 2013 technical reports on some modeling situations such as Lord’s Paradox and Simpson’s Paradox that lead to surprising results that are initially at odds with our intuition. Looks particularly at the issue of change scores vs. controlling for baseline.\n\n\nOther Statistical\n\nGeneralized Additive ModelsAn introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis on generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Machine LearningA gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some application in R.\n\n\n\nReliabilityAn unfinished document that ties together some ideas regarding the statistical and conceptual notion of reliability..\n\n\n\nFractional RegressionA quick primer regarding data between zero and one, including zero and one.\n\n\n\nCategorical Regression ModelsAn overview of regression models for binary, multinomial, and ordinal outcomes, with connections among various types of models.\n\n\n\nTopic Modeling DemoA demonstration of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling in R.\n\n\n\nComparing Measures of DependencyA summary of articles that look at various measures of dependency Pearson’s r, Spearman’s rho, and Hoeffding’s D, and newer ones such as Distance Correlation and Maximal Information Coefficient.\n\nProgramming\nCheck the workshops section also for programming-related content.\nPractical Data Science (more details about this document below). The intention was to cover five key topics: basic information processing, programming, modeling, visualization, and publication/presentation.\nExploratory Data Analysis Tools An overview of various packages useful for quick exploration of data.\n\nFastRA notebook on how to make R faster before or irrespective of the machinery used. Topics include avoiding loops, vectorization, faster I/O etc.\n\n\n\nEngaging the Web with RDocument regarding the use of R for web scraping, extracting data via an API, interactive web-based visualizations, and producing web-ready documents.
