I can provide inference\nfor models on millions of observations, classify biomedical images to\ndetermine pathology, and scrape the web to explore political sentiment.\nWhat’s more, I can help others understand the results and take\nappropriate action regarding them.\nAnalytically speaking, I have a fairly wide exposure to modeling\ntechniques, from traditional models to their extensions in clustered,\ntemporal, spatial and nonlinear contexts. I have employed latent\nvariable models, machine learning techniques, Bayesian approaches, dealt\nwith unstructured data (e.g. text analysis), and more. Moreover, I have\ntaught, written about, or conducted workshops on these topics, helping\nothers gain expertise to become self-sufficient in their own\nefforts.\nI spend most of my programming time in the R world, with\nwhich I have many years of experience using it as my primary programming\ntool. I have written countless lines of code to extract information,\nexamine complex relationships, and visualize everything from the mundane\nto the abstract.\nI spend the bulk of my non-R coding with Python and other\nstuff like Stan. However, I\nhave had exposure to traditional statistical packages, and some more\nspecialized. I also have to consistently dive into web-oriented\nprogramming as necessary, e.g. JavaScript, Markdown, CSS and the like,\nand use tools like R and Python for web-scraping. I like programming and\nsolving problems with it, and I’m lucky enough to spend regular time\nsimply learning new statistical and programming tricks.\nPersonal\nDisplaced Texan… one-time psycho-philosopher… aesthetically leans\ntoward De Stijl, Barthelme, Ashbery, and synthwave… has been known to\ngrow things like dahlias, okra, and exquisitely hot peppers… walks, runs\n& pedals more than he drives… sometimes knows what he’s talking\nabout…\nAcademic Background\n While my interest is in data science\ngenerally, I started off majoring in psychology and philosophy as an undergraduate, and\neventually obtained a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology. During\ngraduate school, I became interested in statistics for practical\nreasons, eventually choosing it as a concentration, and I also started\nconsulting at that time. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and\nI’ve been exploring and analyzing data ever since. \nPresent\n Currently I am a Data Scientist for Strong\nAnalytics, where I provide analytical insights and\nprogramming expertise to enable clients from a variety of industries\nmeet their goals. \n Previously, I was a lead statistician\nfor CSCAR at the\nUniversity of Michigan. Before that, I was a statistical consultant with\nthe Center for Social Science Research at the\nUniversity of Notre Dame. In both settings I provided analytical,\nvisualization, programming, conceptual, and other support to the larger\nresearch community. \n\nI am passionate about doing quality work that answers the questions\nat hand. What drew me to the world of data science and keeps my interest\nis that it frees me to engage in whatever science I like, and provides a\ngreat many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans\nare most interested in.

I work with data for myself and others\neveryday, and use these functions quite often.  \n lazerhawk While the name is more or less\nexplanatory, to clarify, this is a package of miscellaneous functions\nthat are mostly useful to me.  \nIn addition to these, though they are not publicly available, I’ve\ncreated even more involved packages for specific project work.\nCode Snippets\nThe vast majority of these code snippets are conceptual\ndemonstrations of more complicated models.

Most are demonstration of statistical concepts or\nprogramming, and may be geared towards beginners or more advanced. I\ngroup them based on whether they are more focused on statistical\nconcepts, programming, or miscellaneous.\nPopular\n Model\nEstimation by ExampleThis shows ‘by-hand’ code for various\nmodels and estimation approaches, from linear\nregression to Bayesian multilevel\nmediation models, and demonstrations from penalized maximum likelihood to stochastic gradient descent. \n\n Mixed Models with\nR\nThis document focuses on mixed effects models\nusing R, covering basic random\neffects models (random intercepts and\nslopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of\nrealms beyond. \n Bayesian\nBasicsThis serves as a conceptual introduction to\nBayesian modeling with examples using\nR and Stan.  \n Generalized Additive ModelsAn introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis\non generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.  \n Practical Data Science\nFocus is on common data science tools\nand techniques in R, including data processing, programming, modeling,\nvisualization, and presentation of results. Exercises may be found in\nthe document, and demonstrations of most content in Python is available\nvia Jupyter\nnotebooks. \n Structural Equation\nModelingThis document (and related workshop)\nfocuses on structural equation\nmodeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize\nbeyond the standard SEM treatment. Topics include: graphical models (directed and undirected, including path analysis, bayesian networks, and network analysis), mediation, moderation, latent\nvariable models (including principal\ncomponents analysis and ‘factor\nanalysis’), measurement models,\nstructural equation models, mixture models, growth curves, IRT, collaborative\nfiltering/recommender systems,\nhidden Markov models, multi-group models etc.  \n Introduction to Machine\nLearningA gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some\napplication in R. It covers topics such\nas loss functions, cross-validation, regularization, and bias-variance trade-off, techniques such as\npenalized regression, random forests, and neural nets, and more.  \nModeling/Programming Blog\nPosts\nThe Double Descent\nPhenomenon\nDeep Learning for Tabular\nData\nPractical Bayesian Analysis (I,\nII)\nMicro-macro Models\nPredictions with an\nOffset\nFactor Analysis and Related\nMethods\nConvergence Problems in Mixed\nModels\nCategorical Random\nEffects\nMixed Models for Big\nData\nFractional Regression\nGroup Comparisons in\nSEM\nEmpirical Bayes\nShrinkage in Mixed\nModels\nMediation Models\nStatistical\nModels By Example\n Model\nEstimation by ExampleThis shows ‘by-hand’ code for various\nmodels and estimation approaches, from linear\nregression to Bayesian multilevel\nmediation models, and demonstrations from penalized maximum likelihood to stochastic gradient descent. \n\nModeling in R\n Data Modeling in\nRThis document demonstrates a wide array of\nstatistical and other models in R.\nGeneric code is provided for standard regression, mixed, additive, survival, and latent variable models, principal components, factor analysis, SEM, cluster\nanalysis, time series, spatial models, zero-altered models, text analysis, Bayesian analysis, machine learning and more. \nThe document is designed for newcomers\nto R, whether in a statistical sense, or just a programming one. It also\nshould appeal to those working in other packages who are curious how to\ndo the same sorts of things in R.\nBayesian\n Bayesian\nBasicsThis serves as a conceptual introduction to\nBayesian modeling with examples using\nR and Stan.  \n MCMC\nalgorithmsList of MCMC algorithms with brief\ndescriptions.  \n Bayesian DemonstrationA simple interactive demonstration for\nthose just starting on their Bayesian\njourney.  \nMixed Models\n Mixed Models with\nR\nThis workshop focuses on mixed effects models\nusing R, covering basic random\neffects models (random intercepts and\nslopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of\nrealms beyond. \n Mixed Models OverviewAn overview that introduces mixed models for those with varying\ntechnical/statistical backgrounds.  \n Mixed Models IntroductionA non-technical document to introduce mixed models for those who have used ANOVA.\n \n Clustered Data\nSituationsA comparison of standard models, cluster robust standard errors, fixed effect models, mixed models (random effects models), generalized estimating equations (GEE), and\nlatent growth curve models for dealing\nwith clustered data (e.g. longitudinal,\nhierarchical etc.).  \n Mixed Model EstimationDemonstration of mixed models via maximum likelihood and link to additive models. \n Mixed\nand Growth Curve ModelsA comparison of the mixed model vs. latent variable approach for longitudinal data (growth curve models), with simulation of\nperformance in situations of small sample sizes. \nLatent Variables/SEM\n Structural Equation\nModelingThis document (and related workshop)\nfocuses on structural equation\nmodeling. It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize\nbeyond the standard SEM treatment. The initial workshop was given to an\naudience of varying background and statistical skill, but the document\nshould be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered. It is\ncompletely R-based, with special emphasis on the lavaan package. It will continue to be a\nwork in progress, particularly the sections after the SEM chapter. Topics include: graphical models (directed and undirected, including path analysis, bayesian networks, and network analysis), mediation, moderation, latent\nvariable models (including principal\ncomponents analysis and ‘factor\nanalysis’), measurement models,\nstructural equation models, mixture models, growth curves. Topics I hope to provide\noverviews of in the future include other latent variable\ntechniques/extensions such as IRT,\ncollaborative filtering/recommender systems, hidden Markov models, multi-group models etc.  \n Factor\nAnalysis and Related MethodsThis document gives a brief overview of\nmany matrix factorization, dimension reduction, and latent variable techniques. Here is a list:\n \n\nPrincipal Components Analysis - Factor Analysis - Probabilistic\nComponents Analysis - Non-negative Matrix Factorization - Latent\nDirichlet Allocation - Structural Equation Modeling - Item Response\nTheory - Independent Components Analysis - Multidimensional Scaling -\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-sne) - Recommender\nSystems - Hidden Markov Models - Random Effects Models - Bayesian\nApproaches - Mixture Models - k-means Cluster Analysis - Hierarchical\nCluster Analysis - Latent Class Analysis\n\n Latent\nVariables, Sum Scores,\nSingle ItemsIt is very common to use sum scores of\nseveral variables as a single entity to be used in subsequent analysis\n(e.g. a regression model). Some may even more use a single variable even\nthough multiple indicators are available. Assuming the multiple measures\nindicate a latent construct, such typical practice would be problematic\nrelative to using estimated factor\nscores, either constructed as part of a two-stage process or as\npart of a structural equation\nmodel. This document covers simulations in which comparisons in\nperformance are made between latent variable and sum score or single\nitem approaches.  \n\nLord’s ParadoxSummary of Pearl’s 2014 and 2013 technical reports on\nsome modeling situations such as Lord’s\nParadox and Simpson’s Paradox that lead to surprising results\nthat are initially at odds with our intuition. Looks particularly at the\nissue of change scores vs. controlling for baseline.  \nOther Statistical\n Generalized Additive ModelsAn introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis\non generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.  \n Introduction to Machine\nLearningA gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some\napplication in R.  \n ReliabilityAn unfinished document that ties together\nsome ideas regarding the statistical and conceptual notion of\nreliability..  \n Fractional RegressionA quick primer regarding data between zero\nand one, including zero and one.  \n Categorical Regression ModelsAn overview of regression models for binary, multinomial, and ordinal outcomes,\nwith connections among various types of models.  \n Topic Modeling DemoA demonstration of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling in R.  \n Comparing\nMeasures of DependencyA summary of articles that look at various\nmeasures of dependency Pearson’s r,\nSpearman’s rho, and Hoeffding’s D, and newer ones such as Distance Correlation and Maximal Information Coefficient.\n\nProgramming\nCheck the workshops section also for\nprogramming-related content.\nPractical Data\nScience (more details about this document below). The intention was\nto cover five key topics: basic information processing, programming,\nmodeling, visualization, and publication/presentation.\nExploratory Data\nAnalysis Tools An overview of various packages useful for quick\nexploration of data.\n FastRA notebook on how to make R faster before or irrespective of the\nmachinery used. Topics include avoiding\nloops, vectorization, faster\nI/O etc.  \n Engaging the Web with\nRDocument regarding the use of R for web scraping, extracting data via an API, interactive web-based visualizations, and producing web-ready documents. It serves as an overview\nof ways one might start to use R for web-based activities as opposed to\na hand-on approach.  \nMiscellaneous\n R for Social\nScienceThis was put together in a couple of days\nunder duress, and is put here in case someone can find it useful (and\nthus make the time spent on it not completely wasted). \n\n\n\n\n",
