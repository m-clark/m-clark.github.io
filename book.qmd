I have a book coming out! Models are everywhere, from the weather forecast to the stock market, they can help us make sense of the world and make better decisions. But they can also be confusing and intimidating, and the modeling world tough to navigate. Along with my co-author Seth Berry, our goal with the book is to equip you with a better understanding of how models work and how to use them, including both basic and more advanced techniques, where we attempt to demystify models in data science from linear regression to deep learning. It's a practical guide to help you understand the models that power the world around you. 

While not quite to the finish line, most of the book is written and in the editing stage as of February. It will be published sometime in 2025 on CRC Press as part of the [Data Science Series](https://www.routledge.com/Chapman--HallCRC-Data-Science-Series/book-series/CHDSS). In the meantime, [you can access the book here](
https://m-clark.github.io/book-of-models/), and it will continue to be developed as time goes on.
