Models are everywhere, from the weather forecast to the stock market. They can help us make sense of the world and make better decisions, but they can also be confusing and intimidating, and the modeling world can be tough to navigate. Along with my co-author Seth Berry, our goal with the book is to equip you with a better understanding of how models work and how to use them, including both basic and more advanced techniques. We attempt to demystify models in data science from linear regression to deep learning with a practical guide to help you understand the models that power the world around you. 

The book is  published  on CRC Press as part of the [Data Science Series](https://www.routledge.com/Chapman--HallCRC-Data-Science-Series/book-series/CHDSS). You can [purchase the print version there](https://www.routledge.com/Models-Demystified-A-Practical-Guide-from-Linear-Regression-to-Deep-Learning/Clark-Berry/p/book/9781032582580) (use code **25ESA3** for 20% off through December).

In the meantime, [you can access the web version here](https://m-clark.github.io/book-of-models/), and it will continue to be developed as time goes on.
