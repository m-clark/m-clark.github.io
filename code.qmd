A lot of the following are things I have done in the past for fun or personal interest and development. For my latest efforts, check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/m-clark), but note that almost all of my work nowadays is for clients and internal use that is not publicly available. Also, while most of this page regards R, I actually have been doing more in Python lately.


## R Packages

I haven't had time to do much with these anymore, but they are available on GitHub and still mostly functional.  

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">mixedup</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/mixedup/)     
<span itemprop="description">
A package for extracting results from mixed models from several packages that are easy to use and viable for presentation. 
</span>
</span>

![](img/mixedup_package_logo.png){width=100px}

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">confusionMatrix</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/confusionMatrix/)     
<span itemprop="description">
Given predictions and a target variable, this package provides a wealth of summary statistics that can be calculated from a single confusion matrix, and returns tidy results with as few dependencies as possible.
</span>
</span>

![](img/confusionMatrix_package_logo.png){width=100px}


<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">198R</span>](https://github.com/m-clark/NineteenEightyR/)     
<span itemprop="description">
R with its collar flipped, or the movie Drive if it was all about R programming, writing R code on a beach in Miami as the sun sets, R wearing sunglasses at night, R asking you to take it home tonight because it doesn't want to let you go until you see the light, Countach > Testarrosa, but Delorean > all except R, R if Automan had lasted longer than 1 season, driving down Mulholl Dr. at night thinking about R code, R playing a cello at the end of a dock on a lake before taking a ride in a badass helicopter, R with its hair all done up with Aquanet... You get the idea. 
</span>
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">visibly</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/visibly/)     
<span itemprop="description">
This is a collection of functions that I use related to visualization, e.g. the palette generating function (`create_palette`) and clean visualization themes for [ggplot]{.pack} and [plotly]{.pack}.  In addition, there are visualizations specific to mixed and additive models.
</span>
</span>

![](img/visibly_package_logo.png){width=100px}


<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">538 football club rankings</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/five38clubrankings/)     
<span itemprop="description">
This package grabs the table located at [538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/global-club-soccer-rankings/), and additionally does some summary by league and country. 
</span>
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">gammit</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/gammit/)     
<span itemprop="description">
The package provides a set of functions to aid using `mgcv` (possibly solely) for mixed models. Mostly superseded by mixedup.
</span>
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">tidyext</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/tidyext/)     
<span itemprop="description">
This package is a collection of functions that do the things I commonly need to do with data while doing other processing within the dataverse. Most of the functionality is now standard in tidyverse, so this is essentially deprecated.
</span>
</span>

![](img/tidyext_package_logo.png){width=100px}

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
[<span itemprop="name">lazerhawk</span>](https://github.com/m-clark/lazerhawk/)     
<span itemprop="description">
While the name is more or less explanatory, to clarify, this is a package of miscellaneous functions that were mostly useful to me. Now deprecated.
</span>
</span>

![](img/lazerhawk_package_logo.png){width=100px}



In addition to these, though they are not publicly available, I've created even more involved packages for specific project work.


## Code Snippets


The vast majority of these code snippets are conceptual demonstrations of more complicated models. The audience was generally faculty, researchers, and graduate students in applied fields who, like I did, want to go beyond their basic statistical training. However, I hope it helps anyone who happens to stumble across it.  I don't really update this page anymore, as I've cleaned and moved much of these over to [<span itemprop="name keywords">Model Estimation by Example</span>](../models-by-example/), so I would look for something you see here in the corresponding chapter of that document.  In general, you can find all of my code at [GitHub](https://github.com/m-clark).
