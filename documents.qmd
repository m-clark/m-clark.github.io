Here you'll find documents of varying technical degree covering things of interest to me, or which I think will be interesting to those I engage with. Generally you'll find a mix of demonstrations on statistical and machine learning topics, programming, and data processing and visualization. Most focus on application in R as that's what I used to primarily program with, but you'll find plenty of Python demonstrations as well. Be aware that some of the content is a bit dated, but even if the programming aspects are a bit off, the concepts should still be relevant.


## Book

<span itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Book'>
[<span itemprop="name">Models Demystified</span>](https://m-clark.github.io/book-of-models/)

<span itemprop="description">This book should be out on CRC Press in 2025. It is a comprehensive overview of the statistical and machine learning landscape, along with related topics. It is designed to be accessible to those with a basic understanding of statistics, but also to provide a deeper dive into the concepts for those with more experience. It covers an array of useful models from simple linear regression to deep learning.  The book is designed to be a reference for those who want to understand the models and techniques they are using, and to provide a guide for those who want to learn new techniques.</span>

[<span itemprop="name keywords">Latent Variables</span>, <span itemprop="name keywords">Sum Scores</span>, Single Items](/docs/lv_sim.html)   
<span itemprop="description">It is very common to use sum scores of several variables as a single entity to be used in subsequent analysis (e.g. a regression model).  Some may even more use a single variable even though multiple indicators are available. Assuming the multiple measures indicate a latent construct, such typical practice would be problematic relative to using estimated <span itemprop="name keywords">factor scores</span>, either constructed as part of a two-stage process or as part of a <span itemprop="name keywords">structural equation model</span>.  This document covers simulations in which comparisons in performance are made between latent variable and sum score or single item approaches.
