I once did quite a deep dive into the available covid data when the pandemic was at its height. The data was always changing then and as you can maybe guess, it's changed a lot since then.  I don't care enough to try and make that post all work again, but in the interest of posterity I show some plots that came out of that.  My main takeaway was that epidemiological models were absolute rubbish for predicting anything realtime, and the data/reporting was so inconsistent as to be almost meaningless as far as making specific claims.  That said, it was a fun modeling and visualization exercise.

Note that I began the post early on and updated it sometime in the summer.
