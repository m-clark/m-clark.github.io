["introduction.html", "Introduction What approach to use? Preliminaries", " Introduction What approach to use? When dealing with clustered data we have observations that are non-independent and reside within some grouping structure. This could be replicate samples for a specimen in an experiment, children nested within schools, which themselves are nested within districts, we might obtain the same measures at different time points for the same unit of observation, etc. In such cases standard methods may be applied, just as they can be anywhere, but they would be lacking in some respect. The following demonstrates a number of methods that might be used in these situations, but while some will definitely be better than others, in other cases, it might be a practical or theoretical choice that drives the decision on how to deal with the data. In what follows, I will create a data set for us to use so that we don’t have any questions as to what might be going on, or what nuances we are not privy to that might produce differences in the results. Preliminaries Things to note No attempt is made at providing too much detail on model specifics. It is assumed that if you’re reading this you’re already at least conceptually familiar in some sense with a couple of these models. The primary purpose here is to compare, contrast, and note issues. Sometimes a little more detail is required, but again, the goal is not to teach the methods themselves. See the references for more detail. In describing some of these approaches I suggest that some are more discipline specific or more common in certain areas. This assessment is based on years of consulting across many, many academic disciplines, as well as reading many discipline-specific texts and articles, but this admittedly is not a random sample, so take that info as you wish. I just provide it as a means for the reader to understand why they may not be familiar with such a technique, and where they might find more information or examples. Terminology Note that in the following, terms such as ‘clustering’ and ‘cluster’ have nothing to do with unsupervised learning methods such as mixture models. I use the terms ‘cluster’, ‘grouping’ and similar terms as synonyms. As ‘mixed’ models incorporate random effects, I don’t normally distinguish between a random effects model (which could be seen as the general case) and a mixed model, except perhaps when comparing to ‘fixed effects models’. I’m not going to get into it here, but ‘fixed effects’ and ‘fixed-effect models’ are not the same thing1. I will try to be clear. Color coding: emphasis package function object/class link Blame the economists.↩ "],
["data-setup.html", "Data setup", " Data setup First we need to set up the data, and to do so we’ll consider the longitudinal setting in which individuals are observed over time2. The goal is to create a data set with several (four) observations per individual, i.e. the ‘repeated measures’ scenario. Aside from variables that represent individual and time point, I will also create an individual level variable, which means that it is constant for each individual. In this case it will be a simple binary variable indicating ‘treatment’ or ‘control’ as in an experiment. The data will also have a certain correlation structure, an autoregressive structure. This means that the residuals of each time point will be notably correlated with the previous, but less so as the time between observations increases. If this is unfamiliar territory to you, just see it as an extra parameter (called rho in the following code) we’ll have to estimate and by which you can check the model results against the ‘true’ value. Here are the main parameters of interest. library(Matrix) set.seed(8675309) tp = 4 # number of timepoints n = 2500 # number of individuals sigmasq = 1 # residual variance rho = .7 # rho of AR1 model intercept = .2 # intercept time_beta = .5 # time effect treat_beta = -.5 # treatment effect intsd = .5 # intercept standard devation timesd = .25 # slope of time variable standard deviation Now we can create the data. Here are the main components- time, individual id, and treatment. We will also create an individual specific effect for intercepts and the slope for time. These are our ‘random’ effects3. time = rep(0:(tp-1), n) # time id = rep(1:n, e=tp) # group id treatment = gl(2, n/2, labels=c(&#39;control&#39;, &#39;treatment&#39;))[id] # cluster level variable re_int = rnorm(n, sd=intsd) # random intercepts re_time = rnorm(n, sd=timesd) # random slopes Here we create the residual structure, made somewhat easier since the residual variance is set to 1. For those interested, this is an autoregressive structure of lag 1. This means that when time points are 1 measure apart, the correlation is \\(\\rho\\), at two measures apart, \\(\\rho^2\\), at three measures \\(\\rho^3\\). You get the gist. This structure is the same within each individual. Once that is set we draw the residuals based on a multivariate normal with mean zero and covariance based on the structure we have provided. # create residual ar1 = bandSparse(tp, tp, 0:(tp-1), list(rep(1 , tp), rep(rho , tp-1), rep(rho^2, tp-2), rep(rho^3, tp-3)), symmetric=T) Sig = kronecker(diag(1, n), ar1) Sig[1:10, 1:10] # inspect, note that dots are 0s 10 x 10 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dgTMatrix&quot; [1,] 1.000 0.70 0.49 0.343 . . . . . .

This will allow us to examine another technique later, growth curve models, that would not apply to the non-longitudinal case.↩ Note there is nothing random about them, they merely represent all causes not identified by the model that vary amongst individuals. They are an additional source of uncertainty.↩ "],
["ignore-data-dependency.html", "Ignore data dependency Pros Cons", " Ignore data dependency The first thing we can do is ignore the situation and just run a standard regression. This is actually okay if you have very few clusters, and put the cluster id in the model as a fixed effect. Otherwise, this is not acceptable with regard to the standard errors (SE), as cluster level covariates will be treated as if there are N*timepoint observations (typically underestimating the SE as a result), while the standard error for the time-varying covariates will not account for the clustering (typically overestimating). lm_mod = lm(y ~ time + treatment, data=d, x=T) Estimate Std.

Note that the coefficients are in the ballpark of where the true values are, save for the estimate of the residual variance, which packs in all sources of variance into one estimate. As mentioned though, the standard errors for the effects would be problematic. Pros Easy Provides estimation of the effects most are primarily interested in Cons Standard errors are off Ignores the cluster effects, which may be highly interesting Gist: Probably not viable for most situations.

["model-every-group.html", "Model every group Pros Cons", " Model every group We could also run a regression for every group. This is problematic since we would typically have so little data per group, and too many groups to make sense of. We’ll go ahead and do it anyway.

We get the same result as if we had simply run the standard linear model (I abbreviate this as SLiM sometimes). However, we would not get identical coefficients if the data are unbalanced, where individuals may have a different numbers of observations. In general, this is not the way we want to do things, and one of the biggest drawbacks is that we can never examine cluster level covariates, which may be of key interest, nor is there a straightforward way to do inference for this scenario. As we will see later, techniques are available that serve as a compromise between these first two alternatives of ignoring the clustering and overfitting to each cluster. Pros None really. Cons Inefficient Overly complex Overfit at each cluster High variance in estimates at each cluster Ignores cluster level effects Gist: While it might be a fun exercise, there is little to be gained by this approach.

["cluster-robust-variances.html", "Cluster robust variances Pros Cons", " Cluster robust variances As mentioned, if we ignore the clustering, the so-called fixed effects estimates (i.e. coefficients) are correct, but their variances are not. We can get proper estimates of the standard errors via cluster robust standard errors, which are very popular in econometrics and fields trained in that fashion, but not widely used elsewhere in my experience. Essentially, these allow one to fire-and-forget, and treat the clustering as more of a nuisance. In programs like Stata, obtaining these are basically an option for most modeling procedures. In R, it’s not quite as straightforward, but not difficult. There are packages such as sandwich that can provide heteroscedastic robust standard errors, but won’t necessarily take into account clustering. I provide a custom function that will work in this example so that the curtain can be pulled back a little, but the plm package would be the way to go for cluster robust standard errors. The plm package can take into account the serial autocorrelation via the ‘arellano’ input to the type argument. resids = resid(lm_mod) # residuals xvar = solve(crossprod(lm_mod$x)) # (X&#39;X)^-1 gd0 = data.frame(id=d$id, r=resids, lm_mod$x) # custom function to be applied within cluster cluscom = function(mat){ X = as.matrix(mat)[, 3:5] # magic numbers represent int, time and treatment columns crossprod(X, tcrossprod(mat$r)) %*% X } # calculate within cluster variance gd = gd0 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% do(xvar = cluscom(.)) library(plm) t2 = d$time # so plm won&#39;t treat time as a factor, time is a reserved name in plm clusterrob_mod &lt;- plm(y ~ t2 + treatment, data=d, model=&#39;pooling&#39;, index=&#39;id&#39;) summary(clusterrob_mod) Oneway (individual) effect Pooling Model Call: plm(formula = y ~ t2 + treatment, data = d, model = &quot;pooling&quot;, index = &quot;id&quot;) Balanced Panel: n=2500, T=4, N=10000 Residuals : Min. 1st Qu.

Furthermore, differences between the robust and regular SE may suggest a model misspecification issue. ‘Fixing’ standard errors won’t solve that problem. "],
["fixed-effects-models.html", "Fixed Effects Models Pros Cons", " Fixed Effects Models Fixed Effects (FE) models are a terribly named approach to dealing with clustered data, but in the simplest case, serve as a contrast to the random effects (RE) approach in which there are only random intercepts4. Despite the nomenclature, there is mainly one key difference between these models and the ‘mixed’ models we discuss. Both allow a (random) cluster-specific effect to be added to model, but the FE approach allows that effect to correlate with the predictors, while the RE does not (by default). In practice however, this means that they may end up being quite different conceptual models as well. As with cluster robust standard errors, economists, and again those trained in that fashion, have historically preferred these models. In my experience they are rarely used in other disciplines. First, let us understand this cluster-specific effect. In the standard regression setting we have a basic intercept, while here, each cluster will provide a nudge above or below that overall effect. Consider the following model (ignoring treatment for now): \\[ y = \\textrm{Int} + \\textrm{ClusterEffect} + b*\\mathrm{time} + \\epsilon \\] The cluster effect is different from one cluster to the next, but constant for a given cluster. One way we could perform such a model is just to include id as a predictor, thereby getting a unique estimate for each cluster added to the model. In other words, we can also see the situation as if one had simply created a dummy variable for id and conducted a standard linear model. This is in fact how one can think of the FE model, though where the cluster-specific effects are assumed constants to be estimated, and in the past these models were sometimes referred to as least squares dummy variable (LSDV) regression models5. If you actually run the LSDV model, the statistical results for time will be identical. Why would we be worried about the potential correlation between the cluster-specific effects and the model covariates? In typical social science and economic data it’s probably likely that unspecified cluster level effects might have some correlation with the individual level covariates. This leads to inconsistent estimates in the RE approach, and as such the FE might be used instead. In the following we use the plm package to estimate the FE model. I highly recommend reading the excellent vignette for this package if you are one of those econometrically trained folk new to R or the mixed model approach, or conversely, other folk wishing to understand the econometric perspective. FE_mod = plm(y ~ as.numeric(time) + treatment, data=d, index=&#39;id&#39;, model=&#39;within&#39;) summary(FE_mod) Oneway (individual) effect Within Model Call: plm(formula = y ~ as.numeric(time) + treatment, data = d, model = &quot;within&quot;, index = &quot;id&quot;) Balanced Panel: n=2500, T=4, N=10000 Residuals : Min. 1st Qu.

R-Squared: 0.33725 F-statistic: 6128.62 on 1 and 7499 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.22e-16 Note how there is no intercept or treatment effect. In this circumstance of a random intercept model, the FE model can also be seen as a ‘demeaning’ approach, were the model within a cluster is: \\[y_i-\\bar{y_i} = (X_i-\\bar{X_i})\\beta + (\\epsilon-\\bar{\\epsilon_i})\\] In other words, we subtract the mean from each covariate and response and run the model that way (this is also known as the within transformation). Note the following produces the same result, although the standard error for time is off6. d %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate(ybar = y-mean(y), timebar = time-mean(time)) %&gt;% lm(ybar ~ timebar, data=.) Call: lm(formula = ybar ~ timebar, data = .) Coefficients: (Intercept) timebar 5.741e-19 5.086e-01 Because of this, if something is constant within a cluster, it drops out of the model, and this includes anything that has only one observation even if the covariate is normally time-varying. So, not only do you lose the ability to model cluster level effects, though these are ‘controlled for’, you also lose data. In this we lose the treatment effect entirely, which would be completely unacceptable in most circumstances7. There seem to be philosophical reasons why some prefer FE models that go beyond the practical, because I don’t understand the often rigid preference over RE models given the drawbacks. I personally have never come across a valid justification for not investigating cluster level covariates if they are available (i.e. almost always in social science, educational, economic, epidemiological and other data, and often would simply include cluster-level averages of available variables). In addition, few of the applications of FE models actually seem interested in the cluster-specific effects, in short treating the clustering as a nuisance, much like the cluster-robust standard error approach8. Pros Does not assume X and random effects are uncorrelated. Cons Ignores cluster level covariates or anything cluster constant (i.e. will almost always lose data). Doesn’t easily extend to more complex clustering structures. Less efficient that RE if RE assumption holds Technically one can do random slopes also (mentioned in passing in Greene), but nothing out there does. Awkward (my opinion) extension to GLM setting for binary and counts More will be pointed out with the mixed models Gist: If your goal is statistical consistency above all other considerations, this approach is for you. However, given that with mixed models we can potentially overcome the primary issue that the FE model addresses (RE correlated with covariates9), this seems a difficult modeling approach to justify. Actually, FE models extend beyond this but I’ve never seen the treatment in textbook presentations, nor am familiar with tools that do so aside from the latent variable approach.↩ This Stata note highlights the distinction.↩ This is due to the fact that estimation of the group means was not taken into account.↩ Note that you could still get the interaction of time x treatment, which you’d definitely want to examine in the experimental longitudinal setting. In other circumstances and with numerous covariates, this may become unwieldy, and then there are the issues of when the interaction is not significant, you have no main effect to fall back on, and you’re also testing an interaction without all the component main effects.↩ Still applies here, i.e. we can still use cluster robust standard errors.↩ One can use aggregated values of the potentially offending covariates as cluster level covariates. For example, if we had people clustered within political district, we could use average income as a district-level covariate. Such models are sometimes referred to as hybrids, incorporating both the FE and RE approaches, but this is unwarranted. All three are simply random effects models of different kinds.↩ "],
["mixed-models.html", "Mixed Models Pros Cons", " Mixed Models Mixed models, also known by other names, explicitly model the random effects due to the clustering in the data. They are extremely flexible approaches that can handle crossed and nested clustering structures, as well as different residual dependency structures. In addition, they can fit within other modeling approaches that can be expressed essentially identically10, allowing for even more modeling considerations. They also have a very natural extension to Bayesian estimation, and, as we will see later, an alternative ‘latent variable’ interpretation. In short, there is a lot going on here. For observations \\(i\\) nested within cluster \\(c\\), we can depict the model in a couple of different ways, but the following is fairly straightforward and in keeping with how the data was created. The main idea is that we have cluster specific coefficients for the intercept and time. \\[ y_{ic} = \\beta_{0c} + \\beta_{1c} * time_{ic} + \\epsilon_{ic} \\] \\[\\beta_{0c} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 * \\mathrm{Treat_{c}} + \\gamma_c\\] \\[\\beta_{1c} = \\beta_1 + \\nu_c\\] \\[\\gamma_c\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)\\] \\[\\nu_c\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\eta^2)\\] \\[\\epsilon_ic \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\] Putting the model together we get: \\[ y_{ic} = (\\beta_0 + \\gamma_c) + (\\beta_1 + \\nu_c) * time_{ic} + \\beta_2 * \\mathrm{Treat_{c}} + \\epsilon_{ic} \\] So what we end up with conceptually is the standard linear model, but with cluster specific deviations/effects. These effects are random in that they are drawn from a specific distribution, in this case normal, with mean 0 and some standard deviation, which is estimated as part of the model. Recall that we specified these values at the beginning though in terms of standard deviation. In addition, the cluster level effect of treatment enters the model as would any other covariate. To estimate this model we’ll use the nlme package, as it will also allow us to easily estimate the residual correlation structure. The key part is the random = argument, where we note that we want random effects for the intercept and time. library(nlme) mixed_mod = lme(y ~ time + treatment, random = ~1+time|id, correlation=corAR1(form=~time|id)) Fixed effects: y ~ time + treatment Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 0.1328 0.02987 7499 4.448 8.812e-06 time 0.5074 0.009085 7499 55.85 0 treatmenttreatment -0.4248 0.0402 2498 -10.57 1.454e-25 Standardized Within-Group Residuals Min Q1 Med Q3 Max -3.197 -0.5489 0.0173 0.5486 3.282 Linear mixed-effects model fit by REML : y ~ time + treatment Observations Groups Log-restricted-likelihood id 10000 2500 -12630 Variance StdDev (Intercept) 0.33237241 0.5765175 time 0.06671119 0.2582851 Residual 0.90765587 0.9527098 Phi 0.6748 The results show that the primary regression coefficients, known in the mixed model literature as ‘fixed effects’, are reasonably recovered, as are the standard deviations for the random effects (recall intsd, timesd, and sigmasq). In addition, Phi estimates what we were calling rho. Furthermore, there is a low estimated correlation between intercepts and slopes (not shown), in keeping with how the data was generated. A common method for determining whether to use the FE vs. RE is the Hausman test, but it comes with its own assumptions and the standard version is problematic except in the simplest of settings. The plm package provides this if you want to try it, but will only be applicable to the random intercepts scenario. It tests whether the assumption underlying the random effects approach is viable, and if rejected, one would go with the FE model. As it is an ‘accept the null’ test, it is fundamentally illogical, to go along with the other issues. It may be instructive to compare the random coefficients to the approach where we conducted a model for each individual. What the visualization makes clear is that the mixed model has a regularizing effect on the coefficients relative to the by-group model, shrinking the coefficients toward the population average. The by-group approach overfits, treating each individual as a unique snowflake, while the mixed model recognizes that they might have things in common. Practically and philosophically this is quite appealing. Pros Examine cluster-specific effects Can retain cluster level variable effects More efficient than FE (and cluster robust approach) if assumptions hold Easily incorporate additional sources of variance Additional sources of variance may be due to nested or crossed grouping structure and even interactions of random effects Can model residual dependency Can allow any coefficient to be ‘random’ Close ties to other modeling approaches Cons Inconsistent estimates if predictors are correlated with random effect(s) and other steps not taken May have difficult estimation in the generalized case, e.g. logistic model (my experience) Gist: Basically the mixed model can provide everything you need, and not necessarily at the cost of consistency. Such as spatial random effects, additive models, network effects etc. See the Fahrmeier et al. reference.↩ "],
["generalized-estimating-equations.html", "Generalized Estimating Equations Pros Cons", " Generalized Estimating Equations A generalized estimating equation is an estimation procedure11 for dealing with clustered data, and is seemingly very popular in disciplines trained with a biostatistics perspective, but perhaps not too commonly used elsewhere. Models using this approach are sometimes called marginal models, and can be seen as follows, where the target \\(y\\) is multivariate normal with mean vector \\(X\\beta\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\), which is typically block diagonal as we created at the beginning12. \\[ y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(X\\beta, \\Sigma) \\] Here the focus is on the ‘population average’ effects, akin to ‘fixed’ effects in the RE model, though in some circumstances they are identical. In addition, one specifies the type of covariance structure thought to underlie the data. Among the more common are: independence: no correlation autoregressive: as described previously exchangeable: same correlation everywhere (aka ‘compound symmetry’ or ‘spherical’) unstructured: all possible correlations are estimated as parameters And there are many others. The GEE approach is identical to RE intercept-only model approach if one conducts a linear Gaussian model, as in this case. In addition, these correlation structures are often available to mixed models tools, so this alone should not be a reason13 to use the GEE approach. We’ll use the geepack package in order to conduct the gee approach to the model. We’ll specify an autoregressive correlation structure as we did with the mixed model, and as the data was in fact designed with. library(geepack) gee_mod = geeglm(y ~ time + treatment, data=d, corstr=&#39;ar1&#39;, id=id, waves=time) Estimate Std.err Wald Pr(&gt;|W|) (Intercept) 0.127 0.03 17.7 0 time 0.507 0.009 3118 0 treatmenttreatment -0.413 0.041 101 0 1.479 summary(gee_mod)$corr %&gt;% pander(round=3) Estimate Std.err alpha 0.757 0.007 We should be getting used to the coefficient estimates for the population-average, a.k.a. fixed effects, by now.

There is essentially no cluster variance, as it is now all residual variance, and both estimated similarly, and similar to the standard linear model we started with. This makes sense as the variance is equal to the residual variance + the intercept variance + slope variance. summary(lm_mod)$sigma^2 # similar to gee and random intercept only [1] 1.479611 sum(as.numeric(VarCorr(mixed_mod)[,1])) # model that incorporates all sources of variance [1] 1.306739 intsd^2 + timesd^2 + sigmasq # &#39;truth&#39; [1] 1.3125 While GEE models are robust to misspecification of the covariance structure, they are rarely implemented for more than simple clustering14. Pros Easy modeling of different correlation structures Focus on population level effects Robust to misspecification of correlation structure May be more feasible with larger data situations than mixed models Cons Cluster-specific effects are not estimated Not easily extendable to other clustering situations, e.g. nested Missing data is assumed Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) (RE and FE assume MAR) Gist: If your goal is to focus on population average effects and ignore subject specific effects, without the drawbacks of the FE model, this might be considered Not a model! We’re just doing a GLM here.↩ The corresponding matrix formulation for the conditional model of the random effects approach is: \\[ y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(X\\beta + Z\\Gamma, \\Sigma) \\] where \\(Z\\) is some subset of \\(X\\), and \\(\\Gamma\\) contains the random effects.↩ lme4 is a very widely used mixed model package that does not allow the specification of a correlation structure for the residuals.↩ CSCAR director Kerby Shedden has worked on a Python implementation for nested structures as part of the statsmodels module.↩ "],
["latent-growth-curve.html", "Latent Growth Curve Pros Cons", " Latent Growth Curve An alternative approach to mixed models considers the random effects as latent variables with the outcome at each time point an indicator for the latent variable. I have details elsewhere, but I want to explore this as it is a commonly used technique in the social sciences, especially psychology. Latent Growth Curve Models are a special case of structural equation modeling, a highly flexible tool that can incorporate latent variables, indirect effects, multiple outcomes etc. Growth curve models are actually somewhat irregular SEM in the way that they are specified, but for our purposes, we only want to see how the approach works and compare it to previous methods. The first thing is that the data has to be in wide format, such that we have one column per time point, and thus only one row per individual. Once the data is ready we specify the model syntax. By default, the SEM approach also assumes unequal variances across time, so to make it more comparable, we fix that value to be constant. We’ll use lavaan to estimate the model. dwide = spread(d, key=time, value=y, sep=&#39;_&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(treatment = treatment==&#39;treatment&#39;) # otherwise converted to numeric directly as 1-2 instead of 1-0 head(dwide) treatment id time_0 time_1 time_2 time_3 1 FALSE 1 0.1760974 0.6928733 0.1920017 -0.2205356 2 FALSE 2 1.4265781 1.6607311 1.2515623 2.9685755 3 FALSE 3 -0.1383776 0.8689109 1.2446484 2.9954976 4 FALSE 4 2.0575643 1.7831405 1.6413706 1.7078853 5 FALSE 5 0.9899045 1.7892770 1.7883325 2.4579697 6 FALSE 6 0.6079163 0.1161267 0.6956824 0.8326176 growthmod_syntax = &quot; # model for the intercept and slope latent variables int =~ 1*time_0 + 1*time_1 + 1*time_2 + 1*time_3 slope =~ 0*time_0 + 1*time_1 + 2*time_2 + 3*time_3 # cluster-level effect int ~ treatment # intercept-slope correlation int ~~ slope # fix to equal variances (parameter &#39;res&#39;) time_0 ~~ res*time_0 time_1 ~~ res*time_1 time_2 ~~ res*time_2 time_3 ~~ res*time_3 &quot; library(lavaan) growth_mod = growth(growthmod_syntax, data=dwide) summary(growth_mod, standardized=T) lavaan (0.5-22) converged normally after 27 iterations Number of observations 2500 Estimator ML Minimum Function Test Statistic 234.733 Degrees of freedom 11 P-value (Chi-square) 0.000 Parameter Estimates: Information Expected Standard Errors Standard Latent Variables: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) Std.lv Std.all int =~ time_0 1.000 1.048 0.896 time_1 1.000 1.048 0.931 time_2 1.000 1.048 0.863 time_3 1.000 1.048 0.742 slope =~ time_0 0.000 0.000 0.000 time_1 1.000 0.394 0.350 time_2 2.000 0.788 0.648 time_3 3.000 1.182 0.836 Regressions: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) Std.lv Std.all int ~ treatment -0.434 0.041 -10.686 0.000 -0.414 -0.207 Covariances: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) Std.lv Std.all .int ~~ slope -0.128 0.011 -11.522 0.000 -0.317 -0.317 Intercepts: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) Std.lv Std.all .time_0 0.000 0.000 0.000 .time_1 0.000 0.000 0.000 .time_2 0.000 0.000 0.000 .time_3 0.000 0.000 0.000 .int 0.137 0.030 4.553 0.000 0.131 0.131 slope 0.509 0.009 55.635 0.000 1.291 1.291 Variances: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) Std.lv Std.all .time_0 (res) 0.269 0.005 50.000 0.000 0.269 0.197 .time_1 (res) 0.269 0.005 50.000 0.000 0.269 0.212 .time_2 (res) 0.269 0.005 50.000 0.000 0.269 0.182 .time_3 (res) 0.269 0.005 50.000 0.000 0.269 0.135 .int 1.052 0.035 29.817 0.000 0.957 0.957 slope 0.155 0.006 25.828 0.000 1.000 1.000 The Intercepts: section of the output shows what would be the fixed effects in the mixed model, and in this case, they are also ‘intercepts’ in this latent variable approach, so that is why they are named as such. The Regression of i on treatment depicts the treatment effect, and will make more sense to those who come to mixed models from the multilevel modeling literature. If you go back to the model depiction for the mixed model, this model more explicitly denotes \\(\\beta_{0c} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2*\\textrm{Treatment} + \\gamma_c\\). The res parameter is akin to residual variance, and is roughly equivalent to the square of the residual standard deviation in the mixed model output. The above model does not allow for correlated residuals, though this is possible15. The primary point here is not to precisely reproduce the correct model but to show the identity between the mixed model and the latent growth curve approach. Proper specification will lead to identical results. The following creates a mixed model that is the equivalent. mixed_mod_nocorr = lme(y ~ time + treatment, data=d, random=~1+time|id, method=&quot;ML&quot;) Fixed effects: y ~ time + treatment Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 0.1372 0.03015 7499 4.552 5.395e-06 time 0.5086 0.009142 7499 55.63 0 treatmenttreatment -0.4341 0.04063 2498 -10.68 4.351e-26 Standardized Within-Group Residuals Min Q1 Med Q3 Max -3.578 -0.5069 0.005247 0.5049 3.276 Linear mixed-effects model fit by maximum likelihood : y ~ time + treatment Observations Groups Log-restricted-likelihood id 10000 2500 -12732 Variance StdDev (Intercept) 1.0517588 1.0255529 time 0.1551120 0.3938426 Residual 0.2689193 0.5185743 Pros Can be utilized on less data than typical SEM Very efficient estimation Can deal with very complex models, including mediation, parallel processes etc. Cons Tedious to specify even the simplest of models Very tedious to specify even common models Even worse to get into correlated residuals More complex cluster structure is not dealt with well (if at all)16 Assumes balanced time points Doesn’t deal with many time points well (if also time-varying covariates especially) Gist: Growth curve models are very flexible, but they are also problematic simply because they are from the SEM world, which is one where models are notoriously misapplied. Furthermore, there are no common uses of growth curve models that would not be more easily implemented in one of several R packages17 and various other languages and statistical programs. While I find the latent variable interpretation very much intriguing, I personally cannot find a reason for the latent variable approach as something I’d normally consider. See my LGC chapter in this SEM document. Once you see it there you’ll know why I did not do so here.↩ MPlus has recently incorporated the ability to handle crossed random effects (and see example 9.24 in the version 7 manual), but I have no idea how they work in realistic situations with potentially many, possibly time-varying, covariates, and it’s actually done with their multilevel approach rather than the LGC we’ve been discussing. Furthermore, it requires the Bayesian estimator, which, if you’re going that route you might as well use rstan, rjags or similar and have a lot more utility (and clarity) at your disposal. For tools like lme4 and similar, incorporating crossed random effects are no more difficult than other situations, i.e. are 1 line of code, while you’d be debugging the MPlus output for days.↩ See the mediation package for mediation with mixed models, flexMix for growth mixture models, Bayesian approaches for parallel processes etc.↩ "],
["summary.html", "Summary Fixed Effects Variance estimates Conclusion", " Summary Let’s revisit the results all at once. Seeing the output side-by-side may prove helpful in comparing the different approaches. Fixed Effects We’ll start with the ‘fixed effects’ or ‘population average’ estimates. It may be worth sorting by Effect18. I also include an random intercept only model for a more direct comparison between the RE and FE models. The main thing to note is that we would come to no grand differences in substantive conclusions, except for the Grouped and FE approach, where we can come to no conclusion about the treatment effect. Even statistically, the conclusions would be the same, so what can one conclude about these main effects? For one, we typically don’t have 10000 observations for our models, and so the differences would be more notable in that case. I invite you to rerun the simulation with a smaller sample size where n = 100 individuals instead of 2500, as well as with smaller effects (these are large), and see what you come up with. In general, with a lot of data you shouldn’t come to wildly different conclusions with different techniques19. While I have yet to come across a client that actually cares what the precise value of the standard error is, many care about statistical significance. If that is of primary concern, and it shouldn’t be, then one would prefer techniques that get better estimates of the standard error20. In that sense, a cluster robust approach would help, but would be better if applied in the FE/RE/GEE model settings. Variance estimates Here we’ll compare variance estimates. I add mixed and gee models with no residual correlation estimate to make more direct comparisons to the growth curve model, as well as an random intercept only with no dependency structure assumed (other than independence) for comparison to the FE model. Cluster robust modifications alone will change nothing compared to a SLiM except for the standard errors of the main effects. A GEE approach with an independence structure and constant residual variance is equivalent to the SLiM. The FE residual variance is equivalent to the SLiM if id had been included in the model, and is equivalent to that estimated by an RE intercept only model with no residual dependency estimated. The estimates of RE model with random intercepts and slopes but no correlation structure assumed are identical to the growth curve estimates. Conclusion This is only a single and contrived data example that is based on random effects as part of the underlying data generating process. If there is no clustering effect, then the standard linear model would obviously the way to go, but that is also not the situation we’re interested in. If there is no residual correlation, or only cluster-specific effects akin to an ‘intercept-only’ model, little changes from what has been noted above, aside from latent growth curve models being less of an option, and they wouldn’t be in a non-longitudinal setting anyway. In general, the same issues noted above would still be in play for the most part for simpler settings. Specifically, I think it’s safe to say that the standard linear model approach has drawbacks and is simply not necessary given how easy it is to conduct more appropriate methods. Using cluster robust standard errors may help, but ignores what could potentially be a very rich investigation of cluster specific effects, and may be best used as a diagnostic or signal for a misspecified model. I also think it’s difficult to justify the FE approach where we can’t even investigate cluster level covariates, but again, that is my bias, and may not be shared by others. Latent growth curve models will probably only be useful if one is dealing with very complex SEM, and which in that case, one will have a host of other issues to contend with that aren’t applicable in this setting. Otherwise, LGCM will be identical to mixed models, and even some more complex than depicted, and may only make for more tedious coding with little else gained. That leaves the mixed model and GEE GLM approaches. Between these two, we don’t even have to choose if it’s a random intercept, linear model, as they would have similar ‘population-average’ interpretations, and similar estimates of like parameters, though the RE approach provides cluster-specific effects and predictions. Interpretations do change with nonlinear models such as with a binary outcome, but see the Gardiner reference below for how the estimated coefficients relate to one another in those cases. Only the mixed model provides cluster-specific effects and predictions, while allowing for complex cluster structures and retaining cluster level covariates. What’s more, they can be specified to overcome the primary motivation for preferring FE models. In addition, they readily extend to other types of ‘random effects’ models (e.g. spatial). In conclusion then, the random effects/mixed model approach can provide most everything one could want in dealing with a variety of clustered data situations. It is highly flexible, and a very powerful tool to have at one’s disposal. For the grouped SE, I just calculated as one would the mean sd/sqrt(n). I thought about using Rubin’s rules as one would for the missing value situation, but each four observation linear model has very high variance. This approach puts it in the ball park of the other estimates.↩ “More data beats a cleverer algorithm.” ~ Pedro Domingos↩ Note that when there are multiple sources of variance, it is difficult to know what the standard error should be. Programs like Stata and SAS make the decision for you, and provide approximate p-values (via Kenward-Roger or other approximation), while the R package lme4 will not provide p-values. One can get decent interval estimates (e.g. via bootstrap or MCMC), but see the R wiki reference for some details on this issue.↩ "],
